===============================

Python Continuation
As mentioned in Exploration-Assignment-2. Python was a language I wanted to get more familiar with based off the fact alot of employeres were looking for people with those skills. I am still in the beginning stages of learning pythong and now just playing with a couple of functions and still getting familiar with the syntax as of now.
